# Compile Process

I am a stupid programmer, then I dont know use make file or any other way of automatizate the compilation of '.cpp' files. Good luck trying make this work.

## Windows

I used the g++ compiler for compile in windows.

1. Open cmd in folder src.

2. Type g++ -c -o main.o main.cpp -I"insert here the include path" and press enter.

3. type g++ -o ../prog/Snake.exe main.o -L"insert here the lib path" -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -Wl,--subsystem,windows and press enter.

Oh yeah, now you have a Snake.exe file in your prog folder, so allright. If it goes wrong, so good luck trying solve this problem, I just hope you don't get depression wether it goes wrong.

## Unix and OS X

Good luck trying compile this in Unix/OS X operation system.

Enjoy Fun (or not, I dont know).
